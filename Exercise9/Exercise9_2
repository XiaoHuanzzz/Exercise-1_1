Prove Theorem 9.13.

An n×n matrix A is similar to a diagonal matrix D if and only if A has n linearly independent eigenvectors. In this case, $D = S^{−1}AS$, where the columns of S consist of the eigenvectors, and the ith diagonal element of D is the eigenvalue of A that corresponds to the ith column of S.

$\Rightarrow: $

 A is similar to a diagonal matrix D $\Rightarrow \exist P\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}, A = PDP^{-1}$

$\Rightarrow AP = PD$

For each column, $Ap_i = Pd_i$

$\Rightarrow Ap_i = d_{ii}p_i$

which indicates that $p_i$ is an eigenvector of $d_{ii}$

by induction, all the columns of P are the eigenvectors of A.

and P is invertible, so all the n eigenvectors are linearly independent.

$\Leftarrow:$

as above. :)
