###  Romberg Integration

Use composite Trapezoidal rule and explicit formula to obtain $O(h^{2m})$

$R_{n,m}$: n is the number of intervals, 2m is the convergency step.

Extrapolation then is used to produce $O(h^ {2 j}_ k )$, but the real error bound is not mentioned.

$R_{k,j} = R(k,j-1)+\dfrac{1}{4^{j-1}-1}(R_{k,j-1}-R_{k-1,j-1})$
